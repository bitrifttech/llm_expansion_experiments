    np.random.seed(seed)
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)

# Model dtype selection (conditional logic)

model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    model_name, 
    torch_dtype=device_manager.torch_dtype
).to(device)
model = device_manager.optimize_for_device(model)

# Seed setting (1 line)
device_manager.set_seed(42)
